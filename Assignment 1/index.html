		<h3>The Classic Setup</h3>
		<p>Nintendo brough the Nintendo Entertainment System to North America in 1985, two years after its release in Japan where it's known as the Family Computer or Famicom. It was the first gaming controller to introduce the classic button arrangement with the directional pad on the left side and face buttons on the right. This arrangement continues to this day.</p>

		<h3>Two Shoulders to Lean On</h3>
		<p>Following the success of the NES, Nintendo made a successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, in 1991. It brought shoulder buttons to the table while adding two more face buttons too. It allowed for more complicated control schemes. Modern controllers now have two shoulder buttons like Xbox's Bumper and Trigger and PlayStation's L1 and L2.

		<h3>Full Circle</h3>
		<p>Nintendo's popularity reched new heights in the 90s with hallmark games from their main games. They decided to take things further, however, in 1996 when they released the Nintendo 64 and entered the world of 3D gaming. The controller did the same with three handgrips and a 360 degree control stick. The use of the control stick allowed more precision and future controllers would adapt one or two sticks, which allowed more complex game possibilities.</p>

		<h3>Putting Things Into Motion</h3>
		<p>Nintendo's GameCube came out in 2001, but didn't offer anything revolutionary in terms of control. Its 2006 successor, however, the Nintendo Wii did. Known as the 'Wii-Mote,' the controller's remote-shape allowed for another depth for gaming. People could feel as if they were actually swinging a sword or completing and action virtually. Nintendo continues to use motion controls in their latest consoles and inspired Sony to create their own Motion controller for the PlayStation.</p>

<!--Not entirely related to the subject matter, but wanted to include a video that I watched in the past. It's where I initially got the idea for writing a history of the controllers-->
<!--I tried centering the video and text in the CSS file, but my guesses on how to do it weren't working. So, I Googled it and figured it out.-->
